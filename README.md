Instruction to Hexadecimal Converter
Purpose
This tool is designed to convert programming or machine instructions into their hexadecimal representation. It is particularly useful for developers and students working with low-level programming or hardware simulation.

Usage
To use the tool, follow these simple steps:

Prepare Your Instructions: Write your instructions in plain text. Each instruction should be separated by a newline.

Input File: Save your instructions in a file named input.txt. This file should be placed in the same directory as the converter tool.

Batch Processing: The tool processes one instruction at a time. Do not enter all instructions simultaneously; they should be input sequentially, one after the other.

Running the Converter: Execute the tool to convert the instructions in input.txt into hexadecimal format. The output will be saved in a separate file.

Additional Properties
Instruction Part Access: Users can access specific parts of an instruction, such as SRC1 of an ADD instruction. This feature allows for detailed analysis and debugging of individual instruction components.

Error Handling: In case of an invalid instruction, the tool will provide a relevant error message, helping users to quickly identify and correct the issue.

Output Format: The hexadecimal output is formatted for easy reading and further processing.
